# node-backend-two
Creating a Node Express backend enabling GET, POST,
PUT and DELETE.
I have used Express and MongoDB.

This project was created following this tutorial:
https://medium.com/free-code-camp/building-a-simple-node-js-api-in-under-30-minutes-a07ea9e390d2

I thought it would be fairly straight forward but because
it was based on a previous version of MongoDB, there had
been quite a lot of changes and just getting connected to
MongoDB was a bit of a challenge until I learnt about a
change on their side, meaning you had to connect to the
database using client.db.

Some of the methods used were deprecated and I had to
experiment with the replacements until the calls worked.

I used Postman for the API calls.

This was my first try to set up a backend in node.js
and I am still not sure about the structure of this
setup. I researched and found quite a few different
ways of organising the modules.
